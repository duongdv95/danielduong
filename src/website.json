      "body": "I was inspired by an Instagram automation project, InstaPy by Tim Gro√ümann which automated liking by tag, following, and unfollowing. It uses browser automation which worked well for some time until Instagram was able to detect this. I built Instadroid for Android as an alternative which uses Accessibility API to simulate clicks and scrolls. It features liking by hashtag, following by hashtag, and unfollowing with a safelist to prevent unfollowing friends.",

At the end of the game, I noticed it took some time to sort through the winners so I thought of creating a web app that would allow players to submit a guess and rank the guesses automatically.
